My final project may be a program where you are able to control different objects. I want it to be a physics based program so it can
have manipulated. There will be many kinds of shapes to move around and I think something physics based in WebGl would be interesting.

Week 1: Learn how physics works in WebGl

Week 2: Make shapes, render them, display

Week 3: Add physics, interactability

Week 4: Movements of shapes,textured

Week 5: Background

Most likely using three.js to implement
