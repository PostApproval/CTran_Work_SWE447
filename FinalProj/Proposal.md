My final project may be a program where you utilize three.js. I want it to function like a game. It would most likely be side scroller type of game where it would continuously go right.

Week 1: Learn how three.js works

Week 2: Make shapes, render them, display

Week 3: Add interactability

Week 4: Movements of shapes,textured

Week 5: Background
