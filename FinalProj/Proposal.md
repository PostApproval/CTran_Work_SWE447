My final project may be a program where you are able to control different objects. I want it to be a program that can display different shapes with different textures. I want to implement an assortment of buttons that control different camera angles and rotate the scene around. I think this would be an interesting project because it would allow different types of lights and camera angles to be used.

Week 1: Learn how swapping between different views would work

Week 2: Make shapes, render them, display

Week 3: Add interactability(camera,rotate,light) buttons

Week 4: Movements of shapes,textured

Week 5: Background

using the basics that was learned throughout the year.
